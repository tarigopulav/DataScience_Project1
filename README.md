# Emphasis Selection For Written Text In Visual Media
     The focus of this project is to design automatic methods for emphasis selection i.e. choosing candidates for emphasis in short written texts so the right emphasis can be achieved automatically or interactively.
     Implementation is done in Python using machine learning models and neural network models like CNN and LSTM.
